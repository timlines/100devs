//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.

let myMovies = ["Star wars 1", "Star Wars 2", "Star Wars 3"]
console.log(myMovies);

//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable

let firstMovie = myMovies[0];
console.log(firstMovie);

//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable

console.log(myMovies.length);

//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?

let lastMovie = myMovies[myMovies.length - 1];
console.log(lastMovie);
